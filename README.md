# TestPlatformer
This was a platformer I created during a 12-Hour coding competition at Hofstra University on October 2018. As the only solo team, I managed to win 3rd place in the competition.

Aside from the player sprite and the music, the entire game, including the art assets, levels, and code were designed, built, and programmed by me.

The Player Sprite is from a pack called Super Platformer Assets on the Unity store.

The music is taken directly from a 2D Platformer game called Celeste:
